Here is the modified function with comments:
```
export function readFromFile() { // Function to read a file and log its contents
  const fs = require('fs'); // Import the file system module
  fs.readFile('tp.txt', (err, inputD) => { // Read the file 'tp.txt' and pass a callback function
    if (err) throw err; // If there was an error reading the file, throw it
    console.log(inputD.toString()); // Log the contents of the file to the console
  })
}
```
The comments explain what the function does, what the `fs` module is, and how the `readFile` method is used.
