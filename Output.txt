Here is the function with comments:

```
// Export a function called readFromFile
export function readFromFile() {
  // Import the built-in 'fs' module, which allows us to interact with the file system
  const fs = require('fs')

  // Use the readFile method to read the contents of the file 'tp.txt'
  fs.readFile('tp.txt', (err, inputD) => {
    // Check if there was an error while reading the file
    if (err) throw err;
    // If there was no error, log the contents of the file to the console
    console.log(inputD.toString());
  })
}
```

I added comments to explain what each line is doing, including the purpose of the function, the import statement, the use of readFile, the error handling, and the console.log statement. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
