<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To use the CLI tool make sure to change the excecution policies for windows.

To do this run windows powershell in administration mode and run the command:
   ```sh
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   ```
And then run the command:
   ```sh
    npm link
   ```
To create the CLI tool avialable to use in powershell in any directory.

Tool Execution:
   ```sh
    autocomment <filename> ...
   ```
   Command can also be executed without changing execution policy or running npm link by running this command:
   ```sh
   node index.js <filename> ...
   ```
